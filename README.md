# Password manager

Password Manager is a simple app for registering your passwords. This app uses LastPass as inspiration and was created as part of a test. The app uses Angular for the FE and Node.js with Express for the backend.

## Installation

The first step is to download node.js and install it on your machine (https://nodejs.org/en). Version 20.14.0 was used for this project.

## Running
You can find the description of how to run both applications on the README located at the root of the Backend and Fronted folder.
